# Font

This the dx-font project.

Before doing anything please read and understand prompts and attached files carefully. After that create tasklist and then start working on the project step by step and systematically.

After all of that we can do something that will let just use the font in example about it will look when you use that font so make sure to get a way like if its github use jsdeiliver or cdn to access that font so that we can see how the font looks when we use it in real world.

In this dx-font rust project please use any best rust crates like rayon, tokio, reqwest, serde, clap, indicatif, and any other crates that you think are best for this project and then from the CLADE.md and CLADE_THINKGING.md files please understand and add all resources link to make dx-font to have access to over 50k+ fonts that we can access any fonts by search or download any fonts as we wish and then create playground folder to test fonts search and show response json data from font search and make sure that font download also works perfectly and put that inside the playground folder.

I am creating a brand new rust project with all latest crates about a project where you write a query for a images, video, audio, illistrations, 3d assets, Text(Articles and Big Novels ...) and after you write query we will use the free version of let's say unslash and then and download the images inside the /media directory and you we will use basically all free assets stores from the internet - This is not only the features you can changes the format of the assets of the images, 3d assets ... to our likings and all the assets will be from through internet we will first use best free api for the task like wikipedia for the texts, stock for videos and unslash and free iamges providers for images and like this we will use all free assets providers and even scrape internet in some cases and then we will convert the assets inside the media folder to user demand so please use the best rust crates and best apis or websites scraping teching to do this - And as this is a big project you can do it step by step!!!
